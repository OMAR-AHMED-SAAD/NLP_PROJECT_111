Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child.

Their hiatus saw the release of Beyonc\\u00e9's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \\\"Crazy in Love\\\" and \\\"Baby Boy\\\".\"\n",

Beyonc\\u00e9 also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \\\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\\". Beyonc\\u00e9 took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth studio album, Beyonc\\u00e9 (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes.\"\n",

      "      \"context\": \"At age eight, Beyonc\\u00e9 and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"\n",

In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \\\"Killing Time\\\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, scoring their first major hit \\\"No, No, No\\\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \\\"No, No, No\\\". The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \\\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\\", the group's first number-one single, \\\"Jumpin' Jumpin'\\\" and \\\"Say My Name\\\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \\\"Say My Name\\\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyonc\\u00e9 recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \\\"After All Is Said and Done\\\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.\"\n",

Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time. The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Beyonc\\u00e9 stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously. Beyonc\\u00e9 would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it. Franklin was dismissed, leaving just Beyonc\\u00e9, Rowland, and Williams.\"\n",

In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyonc\\u00e9 landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet. When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, \\\"Bootylicious\\\" and the title track, \\\"Survivor\\\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.\"\n",

On February 1, 2004, Beyonc\\u00e9 performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyonc\\u00e9 had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child. Released on November 15, 2004, in the US and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \\\"Lose My Breath\\\" and \\\"Soldier\\\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It and during the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour. The group released their first compilation album Number 1's on October 25, 2005, in the US and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.\"\n",

Her second film Dreamgirls, the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical loosely based on The Supremes, received acclaim from critics and grossed $154 million internationally. In it, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy playing a pop singer based on Diana Ross. To promote the film, Beyonc\\u00e9 released \\\"Listen\\\" as the lead single from the soundtrack album. In April 2007, Beyonc\\u00e9 embarked on The Beyonc\\u00e9 Experience, her first worldwide concert tour, visiting 97 venues and grossed over $24 million.[note 1] Beyonc\\u00e9 conducted pre-concert food donation drives during six major stops in conjunction with her pastor at St. John's and America's Second Harvest.

Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyonc\\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \\\"Crazy in Love\\\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \\\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\\" and the top-five songs \\\"If I Were a Boy\\\" and \\\"Halo\\\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \\\"Halo\\\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \\\"Sweet Dreams\\\", and singles \\\"Diva\\\", \\\"Ego\\\", \\\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\\" and \\\"Video Phone\\\". The music video for \\\"Single Ladies\\\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \\\"first major dance craze\\\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \\\"You Belong with Me\\\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyonc\\u00e9 improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyonc\\u00e9 embarked on the I Am... World Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing $119.5 million.\"\n",

The following month, Beyonc\\u00e9 performed at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. The performance stands as the second most tweeted about moment in history at 268,000 tweets per minute.

Her feature-length documentary film, Life Is But a Dream, first aired on HBO on February 16, 2013. The film, which she directed and produced herself, featured footage from her childhood, her as a mother and businesswoman, recording, rehearsing for live performances, and her return to the spotlight following Blue Ivy's birth. Its DVD release in November 2013 was accompanied by footage from the Revel Presents: Beyonc\\u00e9 Live concerts and a new song, \\\"God Made You Beautiful\\\". In February 2013, Beyonc\\u00e9 signed a global publishing agreement with Warner/Chappell Music, which would cover her future songwriting and then-upcoming studio album.\"\n",

      "      \"context\": \"On December 13, 2013, Beyonc\\u00e9 unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or promotion. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyonc\\u00e9 her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyonc\\u00e9 received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \\\"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\\\". The single \\\"Drunk in Love\\\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple's first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for \\\"Pretty Hurts\\\", as well as best collaboration for \\\"Drunk in Love\\\". In November, Forbes reported that Beyonc\\u00e9 was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row\\u2014earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013. Beyonc\\u00e9 was reissued with new material in three forms: as an extended play, a box set, as well as a full platinum edition.\"\n",

They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the \\\"Most Powerful Women in the World\\\" list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \\\"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\\\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyonc\\u00e9 at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay Z placed at number one on the \\\"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\\\", for collectively earning $78 million. The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \\\"highest-earning power couple\\\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyonc\\u00e9 earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyonc\\u00e9's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry. That year, Beyonc\\u00e9 was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings. MTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyonc\\u00e9 would become the highest-paid black musician in history; she succeeded to do so in April 2014. In June 2014, Beyonc\\u00e9 ranked at #1 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 \\u2013 June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date. As of May 2015, her net worth is estimated to be $250 million.\"\n",

Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \\\"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\\\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonc\\u00e9's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \\\"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\\\"\"\n",

The music video for \\\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\\", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment of jazz hands, was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the \\\"first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet\\\", triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube. In 2013, Drake released a single titled \\\"Girls Love Beyonc\\u00e9\\\", which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's \\\"Say My Name\\\" and discussed his relationship with women. In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyonc\\u00e9 due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen. In July 2014, a Beyonc\\u00e9 exhibit was introduced into the \\\"Legends of Rock\\\" section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The black leotard from the \\\"Single Ladies\\\" video and her outfit from the Super Bowl half time performance are among several pieces housed at the museum.\"\n",

Including Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. \\\"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\\\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.\"\n",

Beyonc\\u00e9 became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \\\"I Was Here\\\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyonc\\u00e9 would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \\\"Chime for Change\\\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyonc\\u00e9 said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \\\"finding the best qualities in every human being.\\\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyonc\\u00e9 is also taking part in \\\"Miss a Meal\\\", a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.\"\n",
