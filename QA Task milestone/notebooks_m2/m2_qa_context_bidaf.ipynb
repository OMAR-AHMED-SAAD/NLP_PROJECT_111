      "Context: the onset of infrared is defined ( according to different standards ) at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm , but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined . the human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength , so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources . however , particularly intense near - ir light ( e . g ., from ir lasers , ir led sources , or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels ) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm , and will be perceived as red light . sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow in intense sources , causing some difficulty in near - ir illumination of scenes in the dark ( usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination ). leaves are particularly bright in the near ir , and if all visible light leaks from around an ir - filter are blocked , and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque ir - passing photographic filter , it is possible to see the wood effect that consists of ir - glowing foliage .\n",

      "Context: the bandwidth characteristics of a resonant antenna element can be characterized according to its q , just as one uses to characterize the sharpness of an l - c resonant circuit . however it is often assumed that there is an advantage in an antenna having a high q . after all , q is short for \" quality factor \" and a low q typically signifies excessive loss ( due to unwanted resistance ) in a resonant l - c circuit . however this understanding does not apply to resonant antennas where the resistance involved is the radiation resistance , a desired quantity which removes energy from the resonant element in order to radiate it ( the purpose of an antenna , after all !). the q is a measure of the ratio of reactance to resistance , so with a fixed radiation resistance ( an element ' s radiation resistance is almost independent of its diameter ) a greater reactance off - resonance corresponds to the poorer bandwidth of a very thin conductor . the q of such a narrowband antenna can be as high as 15 . on the other hand , a thick element presents less reactance at an off - resonant frequency , and consequently a q as low as 5 . these two antennas will perform equivalently at the resonant frequency , but the second antenna will perform over a bandwidth 3 times as wide as the \" hi - q \" antenna consisting of a thin conductor .\n",
