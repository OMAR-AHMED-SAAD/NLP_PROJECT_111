      "Question: how many vector equations did heaviside and gibbs reformilate max\n",
      "Context: the origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations , which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs . these \" maxwell equations \" fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges , and the interactions of the fields themselves . this led maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be \" self - generating \" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light . this insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum .\n",

      "Context: the integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer . phrased as a decision problem , it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k . no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known , and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems , such as the rsa algorithm . the integer factorization problem is in np and in co - np ( and even in up and co - up ). if the problem is np - complete , the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level ( i . e ., np will equal co - np ). the best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve , which takes time o ( e ( 64 / 9 ) 1 / 3 ( n . log 2 ) 1 / 3 ( log ( n . log 2 )) 2 / 3 ) to factor an n - bit integer . however , the best known quantum algorithm for this problem , shor ' s algorithm , does run in polynomial time . unfortunately , this fact doesn ' t say much about where the problem lies with respect to non - quantum complexity classes .\n",

      "Question: what light radiation does ozone absorb ?\n",
      "Context: trioxygen ( o 3 ) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue . ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when o 2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o 2 by ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation . since ozone absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum , the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet . near the earth ' s surface , it is a pollutant formed as a by - product of automobile exhaust . the metastable molecule tetraoxygen ( o 4 ) was discovered in 2001 , and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen . it was proven in 2006 that this phase , created by pressurizing o 2 to 20 gpa , is in fact a rhombohedral o 8 cluster . this cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o 2 or o 3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel . a metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 gpa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures , this phase becomes superconducting .\n",
