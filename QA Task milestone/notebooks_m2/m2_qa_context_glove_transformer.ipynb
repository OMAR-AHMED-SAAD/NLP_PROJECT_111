            "Context: if a problem x is in c and hard for c , then x is said to be complete for c . this means that x is hardest problem in c . ( since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that x is one of hardest problems in c . ) thus class of np-complete problems contains most difficult problems in np , in sense that they are ones most likely not to be in p . because problem p = np is not solved , being able to reduce a known np-complete problem , π2 , to another problem , π1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for π1 . this is because a polynomial-time solution to π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to π2 . similarly , because all np problems can be reduced to set , finding an np-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that p = np .\n",
