            "Context: some organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes diploid , triploid , tetraploid and so on . in classical genetics , in a sexually reproducing organism ( typically eukarya ) gamete has half number of chromosomes of somatic cell and genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell . halving of genetic material in gametes is accomplished by segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis . in haploid organisms , including cells of bacteria , archaea , and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts , or viruses , that similarly contain genes , single or set of circular or linear chains of dna ( or rna for some viruses ) , likewise constitute genome . term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear dna ( i . e . , nuclear genome ) but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own dna , as with mitochondrial genome or chloroplast genome . additionally , genome can comprise genetic elements such as viruses , plasmids , and transposable elements .\n",
