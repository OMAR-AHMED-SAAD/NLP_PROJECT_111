      "Question: what percentage of electricity was made by steam turbine in the 1990s ?\n",
      "Context: the main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation ( in the 1990s about 90 % of the world ' s electric production was by use of steam turbines ) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80 % regime for steam turbines . in electricity production , the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators , which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines . in marine service , ( pioneered on the turbinia ), steam turbines with reduction gearing ( although the turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox ) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century , being more efficient ( and requiring far less maintenance ) than reciprocating steam engines . in recent decades , reciprocating diesel engines , and gas turbines , have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications .\n",

      "Context: following the cretaceous – paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent . from 66 – 34 mya , the rainforest extended as far south as 45 °. climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics . during the oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band . it expanded again during the middle miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum . however , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species .\n",
